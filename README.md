# Project Starter

This repository is a clean React + Vite + TypeScript foundation prepared for Netlify, Supabase, and GitHub deployments. It includes only the essentials so you can begin building new features without removing legacy code.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in environment variables.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

## Environment variables

Create an `.env.example` file with:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

Use the same variables when configuring Netlify or GitHub Actions secrets to keep deployments aligned with your local setup.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server.
- `npm run build` – create an optimized production build.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – lint the project with ESLint.
- `npm run typecheck` – run TypeScript without emitting files.

## Deployment notes

The included `netlify.toml` points to the `dist` directory generated by `npm run build`. Update the build command or directory if your requirements change.
